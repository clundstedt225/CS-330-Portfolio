- How do I approach designing software?
  
I approach designing software by understanding user requirements, breaking down tasks into manageable components, and working in iterative cycles.
For the project, I followed an iterative design process involving requirement analysis, prototyping, feedback incorporation, and continuous refinement. 
These are things within software development that are likley come up many more times, yet vary with each new project.

- How do I approach designing programs?

While working on the 3D scene, I employed strategies such as modular design with object-oriented programming, used OpenGL libraries for graphics rendering, and implemented shader programming for visual effects
such as lighting. My approach to developing code evolved significantly throughout the project's milestones, starting from prototyping and experimentation to a more structured and modular design approach. 


- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science can help me reach my goals by equipping me with problem-solving skills, analytical thinking abilities, and a deep understanding of technology, which are valuable assets in various fields and industries.
Such as with this project, graphics programming has given me a solid foundation in OpenGL and a start in working with multiple shader types (such as fragment and vertex shaders).
